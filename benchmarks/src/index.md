## Pfft Benchmarks

This page contains the results of the pfft benchmarks. On the *x* axis of the
charts there is base two logarighm of the length of the input sequence and on the
 *y* axis there is the speed in GFLOPS. The speed in GFLOPS is defined as the
 number of operations that a basic Cooley-Tukey algorithm would take to perform
a transform divided by the number of nanoseconds the function call takes. So the
speed in GFLOPS is calculated like this:

    5 * n * log2(n) / nanoseconds

for the complex transforms and like this:

    2.5 * n * log2(n) / nanoseconds

for the real ones.

The pfft code was compiled (unless noted otherwise) using the GDC compiler
compiled with GCC 4.8.0 20120715. All the benchmarks were done 
using the test/test.d file and were run on an Intel Core i5 2500K CPU. The 
operating system was Debian Wheezy.



### Comparison with FFTW

This sections contains a speed comparison of pfft and FFTW. The version of 
FFTW used was 3.3.2 and it was compiled using GCC 4.8.0 20120603. The
FFFTW_PATIENT flag was passed to all the fftw planner functions. This flags
results in fast transform times but very slow initialization.

### Comparison of Phobos and two interfaces to pfft

This section compares the speed of the FFT in Phobos (`std.numeric.Fft`), the
speed of the pfft API in `pfft.pfft` and the speed of the Phobos compatible
API for pfft in `pfft.stdapi`. All results are for a complex single precision
transform. The FFT in Phobos does not use SIMD, so the std.numeric.Fft in all
three graphs uses scalar floating point math.

### Comparison of different D compilers

The chart below compares the speed of pfft when compiled with DMD, 
LDC and GDC. The version of DMD was 2.59. The LDC used was from the llvm-3.1 
branch and based on the 2.59 DMD frontend.
